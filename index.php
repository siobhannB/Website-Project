          <h7>Our History</h7>
          <p id="historytext">Housed in a gothic building built in the 1860s, the <br> site now known as the Fremantle Arts Centre has a <br> long and fascinating history. Built by convicts on <br> a grant of six acres, this splendid example of <br>Australian Gothic architecture first opened its <br> doors in 1864, as the Convict Establishment <br> Fremantle Lunatic Asylum and Invalid Depot. <br></p>
              
          <p id="historytext2">In 1958, the old Fremantle Lunatic Asylum was <br> finally threatened with demolition and was saved <br> largely through the efforts of Sir Frederick <br> Samson, then Mayor of Fremantle. His vision for <br> the site was to establish both a Mariners’ Museum <br> and an Arts Centre. The building was restored <br> and the museum stage was finally completed in <br> 1970. <br> </p>
              
          <p id="historytext3">Fremantle Arts Centre opened in 1973, with Ian <br> Templeman as Founding Director. Templeman <br> relied on minimal resources and skeleton staff for <br> support and, over his 17 years at the helm, <br> developed Fremantle Arts Centre’s first programs <br> and services, including Fremantle Arts Centre<br>   Press.</p>
